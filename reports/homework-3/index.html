**Homework 3 - Monte Carlo Ray Tracing**

Student Name: Zehang Qiu

Legi Number: 22-739-809

(Note: please read the [supplementary](#supplementary) section first before working on this report.)

# Part 1: Light Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:**

~1 hour

**Describe your implementation of `direct_ems`.**

"direct_ems" is implemented based on "direct.cpp." The first notable difference is the use of a random
 emitter instead of all emitters. When I initially worked on Part 1, I found that simply using "getRandomEmitter"
 resulted in point light results appearing too dim. While working on Part 3, I reviewed my code and realized that
 after using "getRandomEmitter," I could multiply the result by the number of lights in the scene to restore the 
 correct color.

The second difference is the need to add a check for whether the ray hits a light source. This is achieved by 
checking if the intersection is with an "isEmitter()." This component forms the "Le" term in the final equation
 for "L."

Apart from these changes, the rest of the code remains largely unchanged.

## Shape Area Light
**Time spent on this task:**

~3 hour

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::eval(...)`.**

At first, I thought "n" was the normal of the intersection point, but this resulted in the entire scene
 appearing black. When I found "emitter.h," I realized that "n" is actually the normal of the emitter point.
 "wi" is the vector from the intersection point to the emitter point, and "n" is the normal of the emitter 
 point. Only when the dot product of "n" and "wi" is less than 0, it means that the light source is 
 illuminating the corresponding front face.

**Describe your implementation of `AreaEmitter::pdf(...)` and `AreaEmitter::sample(...)`.**

The implementation of the "sample" function is very similar to the "sample" function of the "pointlight." 
The only difference is that it uses a "ShapeQueryRecord sRec" to construct some of its attribute values. 
The constructor for "ShapeQueryRecord" is obtained from "shape.h." The implementation of the PDF is learned
 from the pbrt book, with the key difference being that it doesn't multiply by the area in the end.

# Part 2: BRDF Sampling

## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:**

~1 hour

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mats`.**

"direct_mats" is implemented based on "direct_ems.cpp."

The primary difference is that it heavily relies on content from "microfacet.cpp." 
This class inherits from the "bsdf" class, where functions like "eval," "sample," and "pdf"
 require a "BSDFQueryRecord bRec" parameter. Therefore, unlike "direct_ems.cpp," "direct_mats"
 uses "BSDFQueryRecord" for construction rather than "EmitterQueryRecord." The "BSDFQueryRecord"
 is constructed with "wi," which is the direction vector pointing from the intersection to the 
 camera, i.e., -ray.d. Once "bRec" is constructed, the desired BSDF value can be obtained through
 the "sample" method.

After that, the process is similar to what was done previously, creating a shadow ray from the 
 intersection. The difference lies in the fact that "bRec" doesn't have its own "wi" construction, 
 and it's not known whether there is a light source in the direction of "wo." Therefore, "mint" is
 set to epsilon, and "maxt" is set to infinity. When the intersection is a light source, meaning it
 is illuminated in the direction of "wo," the light's color is multiplied by the previously obtained
 BSDF value and added to the point's color.

## Microfacet BRDF
**Time spent on this task:**

~3 hour

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::eval(...)`.**

The construction of this function is essentially a step-by-step calculation following the requirements
 outlined in the guidance.

**Describe your implementation of `Microfacet::sample(...)`.**

The implementation of the PDF function is basically calculated step by step according to the guidance. 
 During testing after the implementation, I found that there were cases where the PDF became negative. 
 I addressed this issue by incorporating the corresponding check, as suggested by the reference in 
 "diffuse.cpp," to prevent negative PDF calculations.

The construction of the "sample" function is mainly based on assigning the corresponding attributes as
 demonstrated in "diffuse.cpp." In fact, I initially implemented the part based on the diffuse component 
 of "diffuse.cpp." Through issue #51, I learned that some rescaling was necessary, so I performed the 
 necessary operations. For the specular part, I followed the first two steps of the recipe provided in 
 the exercise slide.

# Part 3: Multiple Importance Sampling
## Integrator Implementation
**Time spent on this task:**

~1 hour

**Describe your implementation of `direct_mis`.**

Consistent with what is described in issue #50, since my implementation of Ems part is not multiplied
with area, so I just also used a combination of "ems" and "mat" to 
implement the "direct_mis.cpp" file. The images I obtained closely resemble the reference images; 
however, I did not pass some of the tests in "test-mesh.xml." I am currently working on resolving this issue.

Update: Thanks to the guidance from issue #50, I have changed the order of "wo" and "wi" in the "BSDFQueryRecord"
 under the "ems" section, and I have obtained the correct results.
